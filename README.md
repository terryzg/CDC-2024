# CDC 2024: Health Science Track

**This is a data analysis on how the dataset on Influenza, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 affects travels in the US.**

### What Are We Studying?

Infectious diseases such as **Influenza**, **Pneumonia**, and **COVID-19** have significantly impacted our daily lives. These diseases have affected travel patterns and disrupted the way people move within and between regions.

Understanding the correlation between disease outbreaks and travel trends can help in mitigating the impact of future outbreaks. By studying how these diseases influenced travel behavior, we can inform public health responses and develop better strategies for managing future health crises.

### What are we looking at?
Data from the **"Provisional Death Counts for Influenza, Pneumonia, and COVID-19"** dataset, which compiles death counts reported by **state**, **age group**, and **disease type**.

The objective is to examine how these disease outbreaks have influenced travel patterns across the United States and how it can be used to generate new information that correlates to traveling.
